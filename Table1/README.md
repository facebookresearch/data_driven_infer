# Table 1. Performance of original Infer.

In this experiment, we measure the performance of the original Infer analyzer in terms of the analysis time and the number of alarms. `k` denotes an analysis with the parameter `--pulse-max-disjuncts=k`.

## Instructions
1. Analyze the programs in `list` with k = {5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}:
```bash
./run.sh
```

2. Create the result table:
```bash
./make_report.sh
```
